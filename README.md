# Uma Musume Explorer

A GUI utility for viewing data from the game ウマ娘　プリティーダービー (Uma Musume Pretty Derby) developed by Cygames, Inc.

DISCLAIMER: You must have your own installation of the game from DMM Games to use this utility.
Game data such as stats will not be modified in any way, and can be viewed with any SQLite database viewer.

## Functions included:

* File browser with search and export
* Audio player
* Race music simulator (WIP)
* Character info (WIP)
    * Main 5 stats (speed, stamina, etc.) for each costume and its rarity

## Remarks

This was really only just an audio player because I was mesmerized by the amazing in-game BGM.
However, since I spent a lot of time on that single tool, I thought it would be nice to
practice programming and expand the functionality a little.

In fact, I listen to the BGM while working on this tool. Personal favorites include:
* `gm026`
* `gm003`, `gm041`
* `gm036` ("Lose" jingle and BGM)
* `gm061` ("Draw" jingle and BGM)
* `gm097`, `gm098`, and `gm099`
* `gm133` and `gm133_long`
* `gm171`
